# SchlafKindleinSchlaf

Alternative hardware and software (Arduino based) to control the „crystal ball led light” to become a slow moving good-night-light for babies instead of a flashing disco light effect.

You can find similar no name / china led effect lights at amazon and ebay. I believe most of them contain the same hardware. I used the following for this experiment: http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00EZMMKEI

This hardware replaces the original control circuit and moves the motor much slower and does not flash or does anything exciting. 

TODO: more details etc.
